   Introduction to SPA
   *************************
 SPA:: Is no 1 Technology and huge demand in the market you might have
 heared about reactjs Developer ,vuejsDeveloper Angular developer
 
these must be some Application called SPA.

S=>Single
P=>Page
A=>Application

SPA it is very light weight Application 
Because it has only page
and we know that single page Application are far far better than  multiple pages.

Ques-I have 100 page website and I have low Bandwidth.

suppose I have 100 Pages website and  I have low Bandwidth
suppose I have 100 Pages my server has 100 differ request

consider 1 person Arrivedd
1 person 1 time 100 request 
10 person 1 time 100 request*10 =>1000 Request
100 person 1 time 100 request *100=>10000 Request
loading Time will be increase:: downtime

solution 
-------
100 pages ------->1 page single url--->single request
1------> 1 request
100------>100 request

downtime Avg =multiple vs Single page
100/100            10000/100

1 Request =100*multiple request
our single page application can handle 10000 request before downtime
ques:-
But sir how single page Application can have dynamic view 
we will make dynamic element or component not page

Ques:-
sir what is Technology
Html and css and javascript

sir Earliare we were using php in that we were binding everythinng using php
but now we are not using php.

How html page can be used to generate Dynamic content
There are to possible solution 

1. Go for Any MVC framework for front -end 
  ex:- Angular js,Angular ,reactsjs,vuejsDeveloper
  
2.use pure vanilla js (javascript and jquery)

Ques:- sir page will .html correct sir said very correct but my doubt is
.sir php needs server but html donot need server
that means my application can run from desktop only

That is all the spa Application uses server less protocols and we need Api'said
to work with database.
And generate dynamic content.

we need a backend services also 
and this backend services will be provided by Any server side Technology

Html is front end               Php is a backend

Hence php cannot be injected in front end HTml because mime type of html file
is .html and to inject php we need .php mime type 

Ques:-
what is the way how to resolve this problem 

Solution :perform Dependency Injection 
and using API using interopperability are the degine pattern of dependency
injection.

Ques:-who is the responsible person for doing this
1.Deginer will do degine
2.front end person with the data 
3.Backend person will work database and api's (model)

ques:-what will be Technology ?
1.Html css js jquery front end
2.Backend php

But there is a stack for everythinng for full feature Application 
AWS serverless 
Such type of Application is called as sever-less Application
 
 Ques:- what is serverless web Application 
 
 Single page Application (serverless) with serverless protocalls and Api's
 
 (SERVERLESS)+AWS SERVICE
