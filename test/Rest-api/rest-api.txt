What is API

Api :Application prograamming Interface
if one Application want to communicate with another application the we may require API.

Interface here means plateform

web Application <----------Human
                             (HTML/CSS/FORMS/VIEWS/PAGE)
							 
The html form admin panel which you provide to any person as interface where he can 
intract with you Application.


=>If human want to intract we provide some GUI or Interface 
but if one app1 want intract with another application (Independent of language)
in such a case we need some interface.

such type of Interface B/w two differ prograamming application is called API.

for ex:
Android Application with java Application
Android Application with php Application
Android Application with mysql Application

Here there are two main Application 
client App1 :Request sent
server App2 :Response Return


let's understand Api as a general terminology
***********************************************

consider
Rail yatri Application
where is my train Application
NTES CRIS Application
Ibibio Application
paytm Application

All these Application Internally sent the request IRCTC.


web Api and web services
**************************

Since API is a interface b/w native(perticular language) Application
and API provides some kind of third party.

if this service is accessed using internet 
it is a service over the web
hence it is a web service or api b/w two Application sharing the resource
over the internet is called is web-api.

web-api are of two type:
1.Soap Api(Conventional or Traditional Apis which generated response only in xml)
2.Rest Api: is a morderm apis Technique which generated response in json or yml.

Soap(Simple object Accesee protocol)
Rest(Representational state Transfer)
Soap:=server full 
Rest:server less

Soap :Any protocol smtp ,ftp,....http
Rest :HTTP(SSL peer off)/HTTPS(SSL Enabled Peer ON)

Difference b/w rest and normal web api
**************************************

In Rest api URL remains unique and every request sent using HTTP METHODS

GET
PUT
PATCH
POST
OPTIONS
HEAD
...etc

If any API follows following conditions
it is Rest Api...

1. it should only use http(https) protocol
2. json format output
3.  it must support http methods
4. URL should we uniqe 
   url will be same but will be unique according to differ http method.
   
 Rest api will CRUD
 ************************
 
 Post Request create(Insert)
 GET  Request  read(select)
 put/pathch update put: fully update and pathch partially update.
 Delete:complete  delete the record.



Note: every rest api is a web api but every api is not rest api.

Diffrence B/w Rest and soap

In Rest format json
In soap format it xml only
Rest format is light
In soap is heavy due to tags

Rest is faster than soap
Rest is not secure
Soap is very secure due to its envelops

But rest can be made secure using variaous token and Authorisation
such token and Authorisation are web token or jwt(json web token) token or Oauth Token.
(orignal Authorisation).

Rest reqire low bandwidth but soap reuire high bandwidth.

When to use soap when to use Rest
*************************************8

In light weight Application use Rest
and heavy Application use soap
for example:
soap Api used to send millions of email in a second

Soap Api is used millions of otp verification

Java with soap good combination
.net with soap is good combination
php with soap bad combination
php with rest good combination.
