 Data Abstraction: It is a piller of oops and used for security concern.
 if you want security over class member and member functions
 you can use following accesse modifiere for access those properties and methods
 
 Access Modifires:These are reserved keyword used a prefix before any class member 
 ===============
 or member or member functions. so that its security can be maintained.
 
 How many types of security can be there
 ========================================
 1.within the scope of class 
 2.outside the class scope 
 3.outside the current class but inside the child
 
 within the class of scope :private
 outside the class scope:  public
 outside the current class :public but inside the child class private (protected)
 Hence  That is why we have three Access modifiere for security scope.
 
 1.private 
 2.public 
 3.protected
 
 Approch of Access modifires 
 ================================
 There are only two approchess
 1.with inheritance
 2.without inheritance
 
 Public Access modifire :- 
 syntex:      public <member-name>
 ---------
              public <method-name>

			  
=>  In public scope :: you can access the member /member function from any scope
within the class ,outside the class ,from child class 

Inside class  | outside class
********************************
$this Own   | $parent_obj from own class  no extend keyword  (non -Inheritance)
$this child | $child_obj form child class  with extend keyword(Inheritance)


Private: The most public is open the more private is close or it is complete 
vice -versa (opposite ) of public.


when in global scope static variable and local variable scope remains same.
but inside function local variable scope becomes local but static becomes 
global since it never destroyed it will remains initialized with the single.


=>From private context we mean that it data member or member function can be only 
accessed from own context even child can also not access it.
for example: 
Parent Tijori


Protected : It have context such that no one can access it publicaly it remains private 
from outside context from the child context it become public.

if you want your data member and member function to be shared b/w only you can 
you childs then declare them as protected.

Protected data member are also called nominee data member.

=====================================================================

Difference b/w public ,protected or private

Access modifire | within class | outside class | Inheritance class(child class)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public            valid           valid           valid
private           valid          invalid         invalid
protected         valid          invalid          valid
