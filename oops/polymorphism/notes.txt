Polymorphism
==============
polymorphisam is same as polynomial

polynomial=poly(many) + mial(Terms)

In animal kindom you remember as topic called Morphology
Morphology means same identity many forms.

Single Identity multiple signature
for ex:-  + operator is polymorphisam in javascript and java
* in python  python
len() in python 

similary polymorphisam can be observed in function .

same name different signature.

function test(x)
{
}
function test(x,y)
{
}
function test(x,y,z)
{
}

This is polymorphism but have been Acheived by using overloading the Argument.
Argument overloading in method

Method overloading(with argument) or Method Overloading

Note:: since php is not compile time language it will lead to fatal error

fatal error due to Redeclaration

function redclaration :Error : Can be Resolved by using __call()
Magic function

Class Redeclaration :Error: can be resolve using namespace

Polymorphism Type:
====================
1.Method Overloading
     compile Time
	 Early static binding
	    no inheritance Reqiured
		In method overloading same method is overloaded with Diffrent Argument
		No not possible in php
		using :1.Argument overloading using  __call magic function
		2.Method overloading using varg method
		3.Using Interface
		
2.Method overriding
    -Run time
	-Late dynamic binding
	-Reqiured Inheritance
	In this when same method is declared inside child class the 
	it over-rides parent method hence overriding
	php supports
	
Polymorphism Best Example:
Girls
why boys cannot follow polymorphisam
Inheritance complextion
	

	
How to make namespace 
==========================
Namespace should be first line of the php script just after <?php ?> 

Syntex:
Declare a normal class
class Test{
//code
}

Use namespace <name_of_Namespace> or <Donot use any name>;

Due to namespace is of two type
userdefined namespace or named namespace
gloabl namespace or Anonymous namespace:no name


Naming convention of namespace
**********************************
Each namespace must follow class name convention
pascal style

Namespace name should be capital
each line must be terminated .
no other code must lie outside the namespace.

signature of namespace
***********************
Body of the namespace of called signature
namespace Testnamespace{

//class and object will lie inside this
}

if some code Resides outsides then compilation error will be raised called as fatal error.

Scope of the class
*********************
We know that in an uncapsulated class we can declare object of class inside or outside
 But in a Enacapsulated where namespace is mendatory class will be local scope of namespace.
